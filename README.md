### Instructions:

#### Build:

* Run `./gradlew jar` in the console
* Put the output file (`./build/libs/newPlugin.jar`) in the `./config/mods` folder of your server.

#### Run:
* Put the `newPlugin.jar` file in the `./conifg/mods/` folder.
* Create a settings.json file in the same location as the plugin file.
* Use the same format as the example in the `./config/mods/exampleSettings.json` file.
* If you don't have a postgreSQL server some functions might not work.
* Now run the `server-release.jar` file (you have to run this file, because it's a special version of the server to work with the postgreSQL server)
